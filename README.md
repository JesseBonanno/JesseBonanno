### Hi! My name is Jesse Bonanno 👋

I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the Internet Edge team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Sydney.

I have experience working in Civil Engineering (which is why a lot of my tools are civil engineering based).

I also worked for some time as a Product Developer at SkyCiv where I built [Quick Design Engineering Calculators.](https://skyciv.com/structural-software/quick-design/)
